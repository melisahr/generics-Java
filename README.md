# generics-Java
By following along a YouTube I understand the concept of generics.
A generic lets types, such as integer, string, etc, to be parameters when defining 
a class, interface, methods. 
In this mini project, I did generics method. A generic method will create one version
for all reference data types instead of having multiple methods.
The generic uses the <> and Thing to utilize to represent as all the data types. 
Another common way, is to use <T> instead of using the keyword Thing. 
There were two examples of generic method in; one was a void and the other was a return type. 
The displayArray was the void, while the getFirst was the return type. It returned the first
element of the arrays for each. 
For only this project, I did generics method but I will also do a generic class in another project.
